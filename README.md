### MICRO22 Artifact Evaluation 

Since our artifact evaluation requires configuring many devices, to ease the burden of configuring, we provide access to a well-prepared environment (a cluster with 2 PC, 1 laptop and 2 NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX) via a ZeroTier network during artifact evaluation. 

Please feel free to connect with us via 
**micro2022p156@gmail.com** to get access to our ZeroTier network. 

After joining our ZeroTier network, you can access the devices we used by ssh commands and the experiments can be started up by simply running only one command: 

- bash run_all.sh
